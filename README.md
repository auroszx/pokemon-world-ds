Pokémon World DS is a Pokémon game based on real world locations. The Nintendo DS doesn't have a GPS,
so we just code some locations and maps based on WiFi network detection. Local multiplayer support is
a must, online multiplayer is not a priority.

This game was created mostly to practice, have fun and try to push Micro Lua DS a little. To see how far it can go.

The game is in a **very** early stage right now, this repo is for development and bug tracking.
If you use any of this code, please add a link or something to this repo. Help the project grow.
